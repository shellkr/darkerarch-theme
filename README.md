darkerarch-theme
================

A dark and minimal theme for Firefox.

Should be used with the [LessChrome HD](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/prospector-lessChrome-HD/) extension. It is also recommended to 
remove all menus with only the tab bar visible. It can easily be done by right clicking the main menu.

The screenshot is how I have set it up. I do not use a title bar for my windows.
